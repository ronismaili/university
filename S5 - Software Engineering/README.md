# QueryHelper - Software Engineering ðŸ¤–ðŸ”§

The primary purpose of this project is to perform research on the capabilities of the
ChatGPT 3.5 llm model in generating accurate SQL queries when given a prompt in natural
language, alongside the Data Definition Language (DDL) of the database.

We have expressed our interest in experimenting with AI and after discussing our project idea
