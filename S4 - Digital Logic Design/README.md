## Binary counter 0 to 7 and 7 to 0

For the purposes of this project, I needed to design and implement a binary counter which can count from 0 to 7 and from 7
to 0. The way I implemented this circuit was by having a clock (CLK), 1 external input (K) which will be implemented
using a button and 4 external outputs (A, B, C and K) which will be implemented using LEDs.
