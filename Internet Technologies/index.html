            <h1>WHY SHOULD YOU GO AND HIKE RIGHT NOW</h1>
            <p>No seriously, take a good look at all these benefits</p>

                    <h2>BUILDS UP BONE DENSITY</h2>
                    <p>Hiking is a weight-bearing exercise, which means your bones and muscles work harder against gravity. This helps your body build or maintain bone density, which is critically important as we age.
                        Studies show bone density declines about one percent a year after age 40.<br> Getting outdoors for a hike could have a positive impact in helping to slow down this loss. The CDC also recommends 30 minutes of physical exercise such as brisk walking, 5 days a week.
                        <br>As an added bonus, hiking outdoors brings you a dose of Vitamin D from sunlight exposure. Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption, which we need for bone health. </p>

                    <h2>IMPROVES SLEEP QUALITY</h2>
                    <p>A long hike in nature can not only inspire a post-hike recovery nap, but recent research suggests it may improve overall sleep quality.

                        In a 2017 study published in Current Biology, University of Colorado Boulder researcher Kenneth Wright measured subjectsâ€™ sleep cycles before and during a weekend camping trip.
                        <br>During the trip, when subjects were exposed to natural light only (no electronics), their melatonin levels increased, and their internal clocks shifted earlier. The study suggests being around nature helps us shift to a natural sleep cycle.</p>

                <div class="main-col">
                    <h2>BOOSTS HAPPINESS</h2>
                    <p>Physical exercise promotes the release of endorphins, a brain chemical that triggers positive feelings. Hiking, however, can improve our mood even more than a regular walk in the neighborhood.
                        <br>Stanford University researcher Gregory Bratman assigned 60 people to either a 50-minute walk in the woods or a walk along paved roads. Results showed that the nature-walkers experienced less anxiety and rumination, as well as more positive emotions than the urban walkers.
                        <br>Want some happiness extra credit? Hike with a friend or two. Social interaction, especially with people with whom you have a strong bond, is an important ingredient for happiness and well-being.</p>
