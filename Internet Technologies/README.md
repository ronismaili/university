## Nature And Hiking

During my second semester, at the South East European University, I took the course Internet Technologies where we had
to work with HTML, CSS & JavaScript to create a website for our final project.

I created a fully responsive and modern looking website using the above-mentioned technologies. The theme of the website
revolves around nature and hiking.

There is not much to say about this project except that it was the first time I tried to create a responsive website.
