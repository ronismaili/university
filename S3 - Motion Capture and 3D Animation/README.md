# Human Calculator

In this repository you will find only my personal contribution to the complete video game. I did not add the entire game to this repository because the final game had too many assets and thus its file size was considerably large.

Also, worth noting here is that my responsibility was only to create the scripts and to make my mini game work from a programming / implementation point of view. This means that I was not concerned with making it look nice since we had different teams whose responsibility was doing precisely that.

The goal of this project was to create a video game, using the Unity game engine as well as 3Ds MAX for asset creation, on which all 21 students of the group should work together. <br>
Ignacio Garcia Marin _(colleague)_ was the coordinator, and I was the sub-coordinator of the group, together we lead the group and created the video game.

We had different teams for different parts of the game:
- Programming / implementation team.
- Narrative team.
- Environment design team.
- Asset creation team.
- Motion capture team.

The final game was made up of multiple mini games which you could access by walking through the open world which we created. <br>
The setting of the game was our university, Universidad Loyola (Seville campus).

I was part of the programming / implementation team where I had to create my own mini game which would be part of the bigger game. I asked my colleagues for suggestions and one suggestion which I found interesting was the Human Calculator game. The Human Calculator was an old Spanish TV game show where contestants had to solve increasingly harder arithmetical calculations, and they could only win if they solved all of the problems correctly.

I implemented this idea in the Human Calculator mini game, although I did make it much simpler compared to the TV show.

In this repository you can also find the Human Calculator executable file, feel free to try my mini game out!

If you want the complete game, then please do not hesitate to contact me.
